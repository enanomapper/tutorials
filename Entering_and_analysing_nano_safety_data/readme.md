## Introduction

The goal of this workshop is to make the participants familiar with the eNanoMapper solutions for
data management and data access. We will demonstrate how the http://data.enanomapper.net/ integrates
various data sets, how you can search for materials, how you can upload data, and how we can use the
application programming interface (API) to access data. This document provides information how to
run the exercises. For detailed description of the eNanoMapper data solutions, please consider
the publication doi:[10.3762/bjnano.6.165](https://doi.org/10.3762/bjnano.6.165) and resources at http://enanomapper.net/.
