This ontology describes how terms can be added to the eNanoMapper ontology.
Before walking through this tutorial, it is recommended to read the following
documents:

# A collection on ontology parts

The eNanoMapper ontology is mostly composed of other ontologies. A list of ontologies it includes includes
the following:

* BFO
* IAO
* NPO

(task: complete)

However, not full ontologies, and there are
reasons why that is essential:

* most ontologies include bits from other ontologies; and,
* some ontologies do not just have core concepts, but enumerate hundreds or thousands of instances.

Therefore, we select parts of ontologies. In order to perform this slicing we need a tool that can do this
slicing and we need to instruct this slices which bits to keep.
