#Hackathon on templates for data collection 

* http://www.enanomapper.net/events/enm-hackathon-2017 
* at Nanomaterials Safety Assessment conference http://www.nmsaconference.eu/ , Feb 7, 2007

The goal of the hackathon is to make the participants familiar with the eNanoMapper solutions for data management and data access and start evaluation of the data entry templates.

## 1. Search and download exercises
This exercise consists of querying the eNanoMapper database through  https://search.data.enanomapper.net/ , download in several formats, and optionally, using the application programming interface (API) to access data through R.

## 2. Data upload exercise 
The exercises include data preparation and upload.

## 3. Evaluation of  data entry templates
The [NANoREG templates](http://www.nanoreg.eu/media-and-downloads/templates) are developed by JRC in collaboration with FP7 NANoREG project partners and released under open license, further cleaned and [released by eNanoMapper](https://github.com/enanomapper/tutorials/tree/master/DataTemplates ). The NANoREG templates are organized as one spreadsheet per assay. The goal of this exercise is to estimate the relevance of the template fields for specific assays, according to participant experience and background. Click on the link below to access the set of questionnaires. Each questionnaire is representing fields from one template.

# 3. Ontology 
The last excercise is an ontology mapping. The number of unique terms in the templates is over 800 and careful ontology mapping is required.
