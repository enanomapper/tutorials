#Hackathon on templates for data collection

The goal of this workshop is to make the participants familiar with the eNanoMapper solutions for data management and data access and . 

## Data access
We will demonstrate how https://search.data.enanomapper.net/  integrates various data set how you can search for materials and how to use the application programming interface (API) to access data.

# Data entry templates
The exercises include data preparation and upload using selected set of the [NANoREG templates](http://www.nanoreg.eu/media-and-downloads/templates). These templates are developed by JRC in collaboration with FP7 NANoREG project partners and released under open license, further cleaned and [released by eNanoMapper](https://github.com/enanomapper/tutorials/tree/master/DataTemplates ). The NANoREG templates are organized as one spreadsheet per assay. One of the hackathon goals is to estimate the relevance of the template fields for specific assays, according to participant experience and background. We prepared set of questionnaires

# Ontology 
The last excercise is an ontology mapping. The number of unique terms in the templates is over 800 and careful ontology mapping is required.
